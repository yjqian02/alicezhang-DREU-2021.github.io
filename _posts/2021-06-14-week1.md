**What I've been working on:** This week I officially came on board with the Personal Content Moderation Project. [Amy Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz), [Shagun Jhaver](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz), [Jim Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruotongw/), and [Ruotong Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruotongw/) are working on this project. Although Dr. Zhang will be my advisor for this summer, I will be working closely with Dr. Jhaver on this project. I met with each collaborator on the project to get to now their experiences with research. I also met with my advisors to get a better idea of the project. Between those meetings, I've been doing some paper review. I read [The Virtues of Moderation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951718756684) by James Grimmelmann, which provided a great overview of content moderation vocabulary. I also read [Regulating Behavior in Online Communities](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/2011/2011_regulating-behavior-online-communities.pdf) by Sara Kiesler, Robert Kraut, Paul Resnick and Aniket Kittur which provided an overview of previous work done on content moderation. On the side, I've been going through HTML and CSS tutorials and applying what I've learned to sketch out my personal website as well as preparing to apply these skills lter on in this project. 

**What I've learned:**
1. It's really helpful to have a consistent way of taking notes and reading papers. I've found Mendeley to be a nice tool and usually take notes on google docs. However, I also like reading on my ipad with Notability (fight me goodnotes fans).
2. It's really hard to center text on a website.
3. It's helpful to have some sort of to do list or time table when working remotely. I'm still trying to figure out what works best for me.
4. Not an intellectual observation, but everyone in the Social Futures Lab is awesome, and I'm so glad I have this opportunity to connect with them all!

**What I'm curious about:**
1. What sort of workflow do other people use to do paper review?
2. Will anyone ever "miss" a paper when dong paper review and how do you prevent that/accoutn for that?
3. From what I've gathered research has always involved a lot of independent work. How do people balance their work--especially now that *everything* is online?
