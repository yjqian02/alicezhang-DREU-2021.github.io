## Team and Project Introductions

**My Week In Three Words:** exciting, (a bit) daunting, and inspiring

**What I've been working on:** This week I officially came on board with the Personal Content Moderation Project. [Amy Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz), [Shagun Jhaver](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz), [Jim Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruotongw/), and [Ruotong Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruotongw/) are working on this project. Although Dr. Zhang will be my advisor for this summer, I will be working closely with Dr. Jhaver on this project. I met with each collaborator on the project to get to now their experiences with research. I also met with my advisors to get a better idea of the project. Between those meetings, I've been doing some paper review. I read [The Virtues of Moderation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951718756684) by James Grimmelmann, which provided a great overview of content moderation vocabulary. I also read [Regulating Behavior in Online Communities](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/2011/2011_regulating-behavior-online-communities.pdf) by Sara Kiesler, Robert Kraut, Paul Resnick and Aniket Kittur which provided an overview of previous work done on content moderation.
