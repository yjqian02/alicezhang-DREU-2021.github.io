**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working transferring our survey questions to a Google Form, selected non-toxic comments, and revising the mock-ups I created last week of all the conditions. It seems a bit obvious, but putting the survey in a Google Form has helped me gain a better visual of how long it would be and also of the wording and strucutral changes/reorganization I need to work on for the next week. fI've also been drafting up statistical models we want to use--choosing which dependent variables to have in each model and etc. Finally, I've also been disucssing where we want to get survey participants. I've been looking at past papers to see where they sourced their participants and it looks like Positly, Amazon MTurk and Prolific are the main choices.


**What I've learned:**
1. Transferring a survey from its draft to the actual form users will see it in is a good way to guage the clarity of the organization of questions as well as the relative length. It also gives you a better perspective question wording and whether explanations would make sense to a participant with no previous exposure to the study. 

**What I'm curious about:**
1. I'm curious about the best practices for asking about demographic information--specifically minority identities
