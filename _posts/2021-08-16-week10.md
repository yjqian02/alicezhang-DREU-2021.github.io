**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working on making final revisions to our survey as well as the user interface used in the exercise during the survey and reflecting on my progress this summer. One of my main (personal) goals this summer was to learn what the day-to-day hour-by-hour experience of doing research actually feels like, and I'm so grateful to have learned that through this program. I'm also grateful to my research team for supporting me entering this space for the first time. I learned a lot about the exciting potential, past, and current work in HCI through my time in the DUB community and look forward to using the experiences and skills I gained this summer this upcoming fall!


**What I've learned:**
1. 10 weeks may seem like a lot, but it really passes by quicker than you'd expect. I'd advise any future interns to take advantage of this time and do all the things they want to, no matter how intimidating they seem. 
2. I'm biased, but the both DREU and the REU program at DUB are awesome communities full of such skilled and passionate individuals. I'm so grateful to be part of this community!

**What I'm curious about:**
1. I'm curious to see how the skills I've gained this summer will affect my perspective on the content in my courses. I'm taking all Computer Science classes, so I'm excited to learn how I can apply both sets of skills!
