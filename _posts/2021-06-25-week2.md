**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working through more paper review, meeting people in the other labs, and brainstorming for the survey questions we should ask 

**What I've learned:**
1. It's really helpful to have a consistent way of taking notes and reading papers. I've found Mendeley to be a nice tool and usually take notes on google docs. However, I also like reading on my ipad with Notability (fight me goodnotes fans).
2. It's really hard to center text on a website.
3. It's helpful to have some sort of to do list or time table when working remotely. I'm still trying to figure out what works best for me.
4. Not an intellectual observation, but everyone in the Social Futures Lab is awesome, and I'm so glad I have this opportunity to connect with them all!

**What I'm curious about:**
1. What sort of workflow do other people use to do paper review?
2. Will anyone ever "miss" a paper when dong paper review and how do you prevent that/accoutn for that?
3. From what I've gathered research has always involved a lot of independent work. How do people balance their work--especially now that *everything* is online?
