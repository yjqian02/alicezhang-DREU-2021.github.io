**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working through more paper review, meeting people in the other labs, and brainstorming for the our survey design. I've set up weekly meetings with [Dr. Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz) and meet with [Dr. Jhaver](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz) two times a week. I mostly discuss questions and ideas that have come up during my paper review and next steps during these meetings. Earlier this week, I went to the welcome meeting for all summer REU students. I am both in awe of all the amazing people around me and excited to get to know them better! We also had a DUB mixer, which is usually a self-organized event where faculty and students will host/attend meetings with topics of discussion on their choice. Unfortunately, not many people showed up for the mixer, since a lot of people were gone for a conference

**What I've learned:**
1. It's really helpful to have a consistent way of taking notes and reading papers. I've found Mendeley to be a nice tool and usually take notes on google docs. However, I also like reading on my ipad with Notability (fight me goodnotes fans).
2. It's really hard to center text on a website.
3. It's helpful to have some sort of to do list or time table when working remotely. I'm still trying to figure out what works best for me.
4. Not an intellectual observation, but everyone in the Social Futures Lab is awesome, and I'm so glad I have this opportunity to connect with them all!

**What I'm curious about:**
1. What sort of workflow do other people use to do paper review?
2. Will anyone ever "miss" a paper when dong paper review and how do you prevent that/accoutn for that?
3. From what I've gathered research has always involved a lot of independent work. How do people balance their work--especially now that *everything* is online?
