**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working on refining our survey and researching whether we want to pre-register the survey our not. I've been revisiting some papers I reviewed earlier and bringing in specific topics of discussion as to if we want to keep our current survey topics or add/remove others to our weekly team meeting. With my mentor's suggestion, I read a paper on HARKing, which is Hypothesizing After Results are Known. The paper is called [HARK No More: On the Preregistration of CHI Experiments]https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173715%3Fcasa_token%3D8bUquxAVz3AAAAAA:EuMypjDT5ur5gGpOOLoIXSK6xZI3OzD2MVrl9w1nWAojxGcNORsYIbIf87qk2JUt2zVrZhIVAdA&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=9244918278825222709&ei=FPPsYNPjHomvywT-qZjgCg&scisig=AAGBfm07eiow8JkX6R2GXtzmAbquNHQO3Q). It's a funny acronym, but when I looked into the issues around this idea, they were no joke! I'd honestly encourage anyone newer to publishing in research to check this paper out because--at least for me--it did a great job of outlining biases and arguments for and against evaluation and publishing methods in research. It also does a very non-technical high level overview of statistical analysis in research which was helpful for me. Our group decided that we wanted to pre-register with one of the sites listed in that paper: [Open Science Framework](https://iconnect.atsu.edu/open-science-framework-research-data-management-tool). I also went to the seminar at UW (they're called DUB Seminars). This week two researchers presented on the designer and instituational spaces of discourse as a response to the pandemic. I helped set up a weekly check-in and got to meet up with some amazing REU folks in my lab. Finally, I got access to a dataset from [Dr. Deepak Kumar](https://kumarde.com/) from their paper on [Designing Toxic Content Classification for a Diversity of Perspectives](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04511&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=15474642984557559046&ei=x_TsYLrSAZHsyQS_8o7oAw&scisig=AAGBfm2A9419fz8G8SukbMZv709mup9Bsw) that we'll be using with our study. Finally, I sent out networking requests to meet with a few professors and PhD students in UW. 


**What I've learned:**
1. Make your resume on [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/)--the formatting is soo much easier!
2. If you're looking to read up on similar work/to get ideas at the beginning of a research project, looking at papers cited in the related works section is a great way to start. An additional plus is that you'll go in having more context than if you were to do a keyword google scholar search.
3. The [google scholar chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn) (I think it's called the Google Scholar Button) is pretty great ;)

**What I'm curious about:**
1. What are the benefits of doing a mixed study (of both between and within subjects)?
2. How do you decide between a between subjects and a within subjects study?
