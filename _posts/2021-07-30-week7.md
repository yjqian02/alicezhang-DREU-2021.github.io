**What I've been working on:** This week I've been working on documenting how we sourced our comments as well as our intended study process. I have also been going through Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React tutorials to create mock-ups of each of our study conditions (sliders, word filters, and toggle buttons). To work on the study description, I've been going back through my notes while doing paper review. Out of all the weeks, this week I've mainly been doing technical work so there aren't too many updates in terms of events. Our team meeting was pushed back because of scheduling reasons (it's a busy week with people moving!), but that was fine since we communicated over Slack. 


**What I've learned:**
1. How to create a dynmaic slider with javascript + jquery
2. How do create a word filer and toggle button with basic javascript + html

**What I'm curious about:**
1. Less of a specific question, but more generally I want to learn more about front-end web development specifically as it relates to creating a personal website
